When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When I need to work on a project from more than one location. But mainly if my project has many people working on them.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because if Git puls changes automatically it may overlap my uncommitted work, or interfere with my current work
