When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When I need to work on a project from more than one location. But mainly if my project has many people working on them.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because if Git puls changes automatically it may overlap my uncommitted work, or interfere with my current work

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

    Fork: an exact copy of someone else's repository thay you use as your own, that has information from the original repository. Existis only in GitHub.
    Clone: an exact copy of a repository. Made with Git
    Branch: a succession of reachable commits

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    I am up-to-date with the changes other people made to the project, so I can change an updated version of the files and maybe prevent myself of adding a feature that someone has already added.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

    I would use Google Drive. 
    It would be easier because I wouldn't need to spend a lot oftime to learn how to use it.
    It would be harder because it doesn't have the diffs, the branching, the pull requests etc.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

    When I'm collaborating on a project. I can make my changes in a saparate branch and send them to others so they can approve them.
    It's easier if I make all my changes in the master branch, but if those changes conflict with others', the changes are not definitive. So it can break the master branch(which should always be the 'good branch').
